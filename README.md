# Visualizing Algorithms

A website for visualizing different algorithms. 
Namely pathfinding (Dijkstra, A*, Greedy BFS) and generating mazes (DFS, Prim), Sorting (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort etc.), Conway's Game of Life, and Sudoku (backtracking).

The website is made to work responsively on mobile and desktop.

Here is the (link to the website, hosted on netlify)[https://visualize-algorithms.netlify.app].
